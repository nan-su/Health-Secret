Take in fewer calories than you expend. Few people understand this basic, simple concept.<br><br><br>
• Eat smaller meals 3-5 times per day.<br><br>

• Eat nutrient dense foods such as whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables.<br><br>

• Eat slowly, and wait 10-15 minutes before taking second helpings.<br><br>

• Don’t eliminate everything you like from your diet. Eat those things in small amounts (pizza, candy, cookies, etc.).<br><br>

• Prepare healthy snacks that are easily available (cut carrots, apples, etc.).<br><br>

• Avoid buffets.<br><br>

• Drink plenty of water, especially immediately before meals.
