2. The Neck Roll<br><br>
The neck roll not only tones and stretches the muscles of your jaw, throat and neck, but also releases tension from your shoulders and can ease neck and shoulder pain. <br><br>
Follow these steps to perform the neck roll as a double-chin exercise:<br><br>
•	Stand or sit with an erect spine.<br><br>
•	While inhaling, gently turn your head to one side until your chin touches your shoulder. You should be looking to one side.<br><br>
•	While exhaling, slowly roll your head downward until your chin is resting on your chest. <br>
Remember to keep your spine erect and your shoulders squared.<br><br>
•	While inhaling, gently lift your head back up until your chin touches the other shoulder. <br
You should be looking to the other side.
Repeat the full neck roll 5 to 10 times.<br><br>
