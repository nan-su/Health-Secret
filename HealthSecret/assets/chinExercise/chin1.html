1. The Chin Lift<br><br>
The chin lift stretches and tones the muscles of the jaw, neck and throat.
<br> 
To perform the chin lift, follow these simple steps:<br>
•	Stand or sit with your spine erect.<br><br>
•	Tilt your head back until you are looking toward the ceiling.<br><br>
•	Pucker your lips tightly, as if you wanted to kiss the ceiling.<br><br>
Try not to engage any other facial muscles while doing this exercise; just use your lips. <br><br>
Hold your lips in a puckered position for a five-count, then release. Repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times in a row.
