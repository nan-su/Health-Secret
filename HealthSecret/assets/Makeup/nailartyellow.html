Very often the nails and toenails turn yellowish due to a fungal infection. <br>
The nails can turn brown and green too.<br>
Fungal infections affect the toenails more than finger nails.
<br><br>
Soak the feet or hands in a bowl with equal parts of water and apple cider.<br>
Dry feet thoroughly and apply some olive oil on the toes and cuticles.<br>
At times it may be months before a fungus infection really clears up.<br>
