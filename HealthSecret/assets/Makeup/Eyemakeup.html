<h4>Sparkling  Eyes</h4>

Wearing make-up or lenses will be a stopgap arrangement for sparkling eyes- in fact using too much make up will harm the delicate skin around the eyes.<br><br>
To be absolutely confident of shining sparkling eyes would be to work on your system internally – begin with the most basic method – drink enough water, a minimum of 2 liters a day.<br><br>
 
Eat adequate quantities of vitamin A and vitamin C; fill up on carrots, sweet potatoes, squash and spinach for vitamin A and guavas, bell peppers, citrus fruits and papayas for vitamin C. After a bout of illness or fatigue take supplements till you find a difference.<br><br>
You can take Omega 3 supplements after consulting your medical practitioner – take 4 capsules a day – 2 after lunch and 2 after dinner.<br><br>

Eyes are the most attractive part in human beings. They are known as the center of attention. So enhance your eye color with shades that will make your eyes shine prominently in your face.<br>
1.	Use a liquid or pencil eyeliner and line your eyes across the upper lash line.<br><br>
2.	Put on a shade of eye shadow that will suit the color of your eyes.<br><br>
3.	Use eyebrow pencil color that matches with your natural eyebrow color to fill in missing areas so that your eyebrows will look natural.<br><br>
4.	Curl your lashes before applying mascara by using an eyelash curler to grip your upper lashes<br><br>
5.	Apply a little or a lot of mascara depending on the look you want. Start at the base of your upper lashes then slowly move upwards. You can also apply to the outer part of the lash on the bottom lid.<br><br>
