 Use an emery board rather than a file to shape nails, file along the same direction.<br><br>

 Moisturize the nails along with the hands with a good moisturizing lotion as the Vitamin E and collagen is good for nails. 
<br><br>
 Try not to use a nail polish remover very often as the chemicals and alcohol can make the nails brittle. 
<br><br>
 Use a pair of gloves while gardening, or handling harsh detergents and cleaning agents.
<br><br>
 Always trim the toe nails in a straight line as cutting them in deep curves can result in split nails in the corners and ingrown nails and at times infected toes.
<br><br>
 For pretty nails we can dip the nails and toes in warm olive oil for 15-20 minutes 3 -4 times a week. The nails take on a healthy hue and are less brittle.
<br><br>
 Dipping the nails in a cup of warm water to which a spoonful of fresh lemon juice is added, brightens the nails and removes stains. A cotton ball dipped in lemon juice can be scrubbed on the nails and then gently washed with warm water.
<br><br>
 For strong and pretty nails, dip them in warm mustard oil for 15-20 minutes; gently massage the nail area and fingers as this improves blood circulation.
