<h4>Do</h4><br>
1.	Rubbing the inside fibrous part of the peel, of a ripe banana, makes your teeth sparkle.<br><br>
2.	Juice of half a lemon when rubbed firmly but gently on the teeth removes yellow stains and tartar.<br><br>
3.	Strawberries are very good for whitening teeth. They can be rubbed on the teeth in pureed form or cut into halves and used.<br><br>
4.	For quick results dip your toothbrush in hydrogen peroxide and then gently brush the teeth.<br><br>
5.	Table salt may be used to rub stains off the teeth. Use fingertips for best results.<br><br>
6.	Use the inside of an orange peel to rub the teeth for good results.<br><br>
7.	Munching on crunchy fruits and vegetables like apples, carrots, cucumber, celery and parsley help in removing stains on teeth.<br><br>
8.	It is better to drink green tea or herbal tea as black tea does cause some staining on the teeth.<br>
<br>
<h4>Don’t</h4><br>
1.	Fizzy drinks peel away the tooth enamel due to the acids in them and make the teeth weak and yellowish.<br><br>
2.	Drugs like cocaine, ecstasy, etc, are not only bad for health but also have a telling affect on the teeth as they restrict blood flow to the gums and cause extensive gum damage.<br><br>
3.	Smoking is also a major don’t for dental health as well as for general health. Nicotine leaves a residue on teeth causing yellowish stains on them. <br><br>
4.	Dark colored juices, like cranberry juice, leave stains on teeth due to the pigment and sugar they contain. Drink such juices with a straw.<br><br>
5.	Black coffee is also a culprit against sparkling, white teeth.<br><br>
6.	Tomato sauce and balsamic vinegar are said to cause staining of teeth.<br><br>
7.	Red wine is said to stain the teeth as well as wear away tooth enamel. It is easiest to swish some plain water in the mouth while at parties.<br><br>
