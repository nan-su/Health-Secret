Stand with the feet together, and lift up the left leg with a pointed toe, putting your body weight onto the standing, right leg. <br><br>
Continue to lift your leg and drop the head and torso so they form a straight horizontal line from head to toe with the arms at your sides. <br><br>
Engage your core and make sure the left thigh, hip, and toes are aligned.<br><br>
Remain facing down and keep your back as straight as possible.<br><br>
Ensure your right knee doesn't lock and center the weight on the middle of the foot. <br><br>
Hold for 5 breaths and then slowly return to standing.<br><br>
Switch legs and repeat.
