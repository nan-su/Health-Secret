1.	Always wash hair with cool or cold water as hot water will dry out hair and add to frizz.<br><br>
2.	Don’t shampoo more than twice a week – using shampoos which don’t lather much.<br><br>
3.	Try not to wrap a towel around hair – blot – using a pure cotton towel.<br><br>
4.	Comb out hair or brush it while it is wet as dry hair will pouf up and become brittle. Comb hair with wet fingers.<br><br>
5.	Always use a conditioner after a shampoo. When the hair looks extra unkempt – dilute some conditioner and apply it to the ends of hair.<br><br>
6.	Hot oil treatment is ineffective for this hair type as oil forms a coating and does not enter hair cells.<br><br>

7.	Always wear a cap while swimming, to save it from chlorine or salt and strong sunlight as all of these will tend to cause frizz.<br><br>
8.	Humid climate causes hair to lose moisture and dry more than normal. A last rinse with carbonated water or sparkling water can be a great help.<br>
<br>
9.	Make it a point to visit a hair salon once in three months, so that split ends can be trimmed.<br><br>
10.	Wearing a head band after a shampoo, will flatten hair on the crown and leave the ends curly<br>
<br>
These are some homemade hair masks for curly hair to bring a glossy sheen to pretty curls<br>

1.	Add 2 egg yolks to a cup of warm water.<br>

Add 1 teaspoon of honey<br>

Add a few drops of any essential oil.<br>

Apply this mixture to hair and leave for an hour. Wash hair and pat dry. Do this after hair has been shampooed.<br><br>
2.	Take pulp of half an avocado<br>

1 cup of mayonnaise<br>

Blend both together and apply on hair. Wear a shower cap. Leave this on hair for ½ hour before washing.<br><br>
