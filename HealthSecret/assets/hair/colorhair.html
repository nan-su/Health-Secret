<h3>Do!</h3><br>
1.	When you color hair 2 -3 shades darker or lighter than the original shade of hair color the coloring lasts longer.<br><br>
2.	Wait for two weeks after a hair color or before, if you absolutely need to perm or straighten hair.
<br><br>
3.	It is best to use a shampoo, which is especially formulated for colored hair.<br><br>
4.	It is best to shampoo colored hair with cool water, as with hot water the color tends to fade.<br><br>
5.	Always use a conditioner – even if your hair is fine or thin.<br><br>
6.	Use a dry shampoo to limit the number of washes, and remove excess oil from the scalp.<br><br>
7.	Use a towel to dry moisture from hair.<br><br>
8.	Use a cap for swimming as both chlorine and salt water will leech color.<br><br>
9.	Drink a lot of water and juices so that the body is hydrated keeping hair nourished and moisturized from within.<br>
<br>
<h3>Don’t!</h3><br>
1.	Water can drain out color molecules from hair, so wash hair with just enough water.<br><br>
2.	Avoid using hair dryers, hair tongs or hot irons as these make the hair porous, which will not hold color well.<br><br>
3.	Exposure to direct sunlight will fade color, use a scarf or hat whenever possible.<br><br>
4.	Don’t color entire lengths of hair; touching up the roots as hair grows will keep the hair from breaking due to chemicals.<br><br>
