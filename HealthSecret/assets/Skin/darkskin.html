<h3>Don’t!</h3>
1.	Avoid wearing tight clothing or synthetic fabrics too often as this will cause excessive friction.<br><br>
2.	Take care not to spray deodorants directly on the skin, keep a distance of 6 cm and spray. Chemicals present in deodorants are a cause for darkened skin.<br><br>
3.	Restrict use of depilatory creams as the chemicals darken skin. When you do use a hair removing cream – wash underarm thoroughly with warm water. Use a mudpack made with fullers earth as this will absorb all the chemicals and leave the area clean and dry.<br><br>
4.	When the arms are very flabby and heavy due to obesity – dark underarms can result.<br><br>
<h3>Do!</h3>
5.	Add lemon juice to baking soda and apply this paste, leave it till it dries and wash. Dry thoroughly.<br><br>
6.	Rub the underarm area with a slice of potato. Potato juice can also be applied with good results as it can bleach skin.<br><br>
7.	To 1 tablespoon of sandalwood powder add enough rose water to make a paste. Apply and leave for 15-20 minutes. Wash and dry thoroughly.<br><br>
8.	Make a scrub with 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon of powdered walnuts or peanuts. Apply and leave on for 20 minutes. Honey nourishes the skin, while lime acts as a bleaching agent and nuts provide essential nutrients and oils.<br><br>
9.	Mash 1 ripe banana and combine the pulp with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, a pinch of turmeric powder and apply, leave for 20 minutes. Wash off and dry thoroughly.<br><br>
10.	Try to use an anti fungal powder or alum powder instead of a deodorant.<br><br>
