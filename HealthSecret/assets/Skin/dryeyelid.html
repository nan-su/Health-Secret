1.	Castor oil helps dryness of the eyelids. Aloe Vera gel gives immediate relief to eyelid rashes and scabs that are a result of dry skin and flakes. Use fresh gel if it is available or a preparation which has no preservatives.<br><br>
2.	Give warm compresses to the eyes three to four times a day; use a clean wash cloth dipped in warm water – squeeze out excess water and place on both eye areas for 10-15 minutes. Continue at least once a day even when the eyelids are better.<br><br>
3.	Wear a sunscreen and goggles whenever you go out in the sun.<br><br>
4.	Avoid touching the eye area with unwashed hands.<br><br>
5.	Cleanse face and eyes completely of make up before going to bed every night. Apply a moisturizer that suits you and keep pillows and comforters well aired and dusted. Vacuum the house regularly.<br><br>
