1.	Always use a sunscreen before you leave home, an SPF 30, and if you are indoors you can use a SPF 15 sunscreen cream. Reapply at midday.<br><br>
2.	Drink enough water - at least 8 glasses a day to keep your skin well hydrated and sound sleep with some exercise to make you perspire and open your pores.<br><br>
3.	Cleanse your face well after a long day of work. Do this by using an oil or cream to remove make-up and wash your face with a gentle face wash.<br><br>
4.	It is very important to moisturize your skin - use oil or cream of your choice, Aloe Vera gel is ideal for a dry skin.<br><br>
5.	Exfoliate the skin on a daily basis by using face scrubs. For a dry skin mix some salt and sugar and gently massage the skin with this till it melts, the hydroxyl acid present removes blemishes and dark spots also.<br><br>
6.	Use a face mask after a scrub - but not after a fruit mask after a salt and sugar scrub, as it can aggravate the skin and make it very sensitive.<br><br>
