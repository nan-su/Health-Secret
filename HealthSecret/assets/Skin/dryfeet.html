1.	Combine a spoonful of olive oil with a few drops of lemon juice and a few drops of lavender oil.<br><br>
2. Shake well till the oil becomes thick and creamy. Apply on feet and leave it on for an hour at least.<br><br>
3.	Apply vegetable oil on the feet and wear a pair of socks. This can be kept on overnight for best benefit.<br><br>
4.	Petroleum jelly is very popularly used for dry feet. Apply a thick layer at bed time and cover with cotton socks; repeat on a regular basis to keep the feet soft and smooth.<br><br>
