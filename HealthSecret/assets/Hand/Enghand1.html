Hand and finger exercises can help strengthen your hands and fingers, increase your range of motion, and give you pain relief. <br><br>Stretch only until you feel tightness. <br><br>You shouldn't feel pain. <br><br>Start with this simple stretch:
•	Make a gentle fist, wrapping your thumb across your fingers.<br><br>
•	Hold for 30 to 60 seconds. Release and spread your fingers wide.<br><br>
•	Repeat with both hands at least four times.<br><br>
