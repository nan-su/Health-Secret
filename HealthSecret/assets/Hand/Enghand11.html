If your hands and fingers feel painful and stiff, try warming them up before you exercise.<br><br> This can make it easier to move and stretch. <br><br>Use a heating pad or soak them in warm water for about five to 10 minutes. <br><br>Or, for a deeper warmth, rub some oil on your hands, put on a pair of rubber gloves, and then soak them in warm water for a few minutes.
