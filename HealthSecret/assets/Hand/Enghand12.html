Playing with putty or clay is a great way to increase the range of motion in your fingers and strengthen your hands at the same time. <br><br>And it won't even feel like exercise. <br><br>Just follow the kids' lead -- squish the clay into a ball, roll it into long "snakes" with your palms, or use your fingertips to pinch spikes on a dinosaur.
