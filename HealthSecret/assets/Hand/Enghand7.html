Strengthening the muscles of your thumbs can help you grab and lift heavy things like cans and bottles.<br><br>
•	Put your hand flat on a table. Wrap a rubber band around your hand at the base of your finger joints.<br><br>
•	Gently move your thumb away from your fingers as far as you can.<br><br>
•	Hold for 30 to 60 seconds and release.<br><br>
•	Repeat 10 to 15 times with both hands. You can do this exercise two to three times a week, but rest your hands for 48 hours in between sessions. <br><br>
