<h3>People with spinal or neck problems are not advised to do this exercise.</h3><br><br>

STEP 2<br><br><br>

Tilt the head forward, as if to touch the chin to the chest.<br><br>
(Do not actually do this of course) and do not strain, but simply to catch that point of tension.<br><br>
Return to your base-line position.<br><br>
Repeat three times.<br><br>
Very slowly, move the head backward, just to feel that point of tension. Go no further. <br><br>
Return to your base-line position.<br><br>
Repeat three times.
